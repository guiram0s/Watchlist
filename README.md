- **Separation of Concerns**: Different files handle specific functionalities, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilizes classes like `Movie` and `User` to encapsulate data and related methods.
- **MVC-Like Structure**: While not a strict MVC framework, the project separates data handling (`Movie.php`, `User.php`), presentation (`index.php`, `InfoPage.php`), and control logic (`Filmes.php`, `Utilizadores.php`).
